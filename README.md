# EtherealNexus: Decentralized NFT Marketplace Backend

A Graph-indexed, gas-optimized smart contract suite enabling fractionalized ownership and royalties via Layer-2 scaling.

EtherealNexus provides a robust and scalable backend infrastructure for building decentralized NFT marketplaces. Built with a focus on gas efficiency and leveraging the power of Layer-2 scaling solutions, EtherealNexus aims to democratize access to NFT ownership and trading. It achieves this by implementing fractionalized ownership, enabling users to purchase and trade portions of high-value NFTs, thereby lowering the barrier to entry. Furthermore, the system incorporates a sophisticated royalty management mechanism that automatically distributes proceeds to creators on secondary sales, ensuring fair compensation and incentivizing artistic innovation. The core of EtherealNexus lies in its meticulously crafted smart contracts which are thoroughly audited and optimized for minimal gas consumption, drastically reducing transaction costs compared to traditional on-chain marketplaces.

The project utilizes The Graph protocol for indexing NFT metadata and transaction history, allowing for fast and efficient querying and retrieval of information. This is crucial for providing a seamless user experience when browsing and searching for NFTs. By offloading the indexing responsibilities to The Graph, the smart contracts remain lean and focused on core functionality, further contributing to gas savings. The integration with Layer-2 scaling solutions such as Polygon or Arbitrum further reduces transaction fees, making it economically viable for users to trade NFTs of any value. The EtherealNexus system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing developers to easily integrate it into existing platforms or build entirely new NFT marketplaces on top of its foundation.

The architectural design prioritizes security and transparency. All smart contract interactions are auditable on the blockchain, and the code is open-source, allowing for community review and contribution. The royalty distribution mechanism is enforced at the smart contract level, eliminating the risk of intermediaries withholding payments. EtherealNexus is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for customization of royalty percentages, fractionalization parameters, and integration with various Layer-2 scaling solutions. The long-term vision for EtherealNexus is to become a foundational component of the decentralized NFT ecosystem, fostering innovation and empowering creators and collectors alike.

## Key Features

*   **Fractionalized NFT Ownership:** Allows for the splitting of NFTs into ERC-20 tokens, enabling partial ownership and increased liquidity. The smart contracts utilize a vault-based approach for securely managing the underlying NFT while fractional tokens are traded.

*   **Automated Royalty Distribution:** Smart contract logic ensures that royalties are automatically paid to creators upon secondary sales. Customizable royalty percentages are stored on-chain and enforced during each transaction. This prevents royalty evasion and ensures fair compensation for artists.

*   **Gas-Optimized Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts are meticulously optimized for gas efficiency using techniques such as minimizing state variables, utilizing packed storage, and employing efficient data structures. Rigorous testing and auditing are performed to identify and eliminate potential gas inefficiencies.

*   **Layer-2 Scaling Integration:** Seamless integration with Layer-2 scaling solutions like Polygon or Arbitrum reduces transaction fees and increases throughput. This enables users to trade NFTs quickly and affordably. The system supports customizable bridge implementations for transferring NFTs and fractional tokens between Layer-1 and Layer-2.

*   **Graph Protocol Indexing:** NFT metadata and transaction history are indexed using The Graph protocol, enabling fast and efficient querying and retrieval of information. This provides a smooth and responsive user experience when browsing and searching for NFTs.

*   **Modular Architecture:** The system is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy customization and extension. Developers can easily integrate EtherealNexus into existing platforms or build new NFT marketplaces on top of its foundation.

*   **Secure and Auditable:** All smart contract interactions are auditable on the blockchain, and the code is open-source, allowing for community review and contribution. Formal verification techniques are employed to ensure the correctness and security of the smart contracts.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go:** The backend is written in Go, leveraging its performance, concurrency, and strong standard library for building reliable and scalable applications.
*   **Ethereum Smart Contracts (Solidity):** Smart contracts are written in Solidity and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain (or a compatible Layer-2 solution).
*   **The Graph Protocol:** Used for indexing NFT metadata and transaction history, enabling fast and efficient querying.
*   **Geth:** Ethereum client used for interacting with the blockchain.
*   **Docker:** Used for containerizing the application for easy deployment and management.
*   **IPFS:** InterPlanetary File System used for decentralized storage of NFT metadata and media.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/EtherealNexus.git
    cd EtherealNexus

2.  **Install Go dependencies:**
    go mod download
    go mod vendor

3.  **Install Hardhat (for smart contract deployment):**
    npm install -g hardhat

4.  **Install Docker (if you plan to use Docker):** Follow the instructions on the Docker website for your operating system.

5.  **Compile Smart Contracts:**
    npx hardhat compile

## Configuration

The application relies on environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with the following variables:



*   `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for the PostgreSQL database.
*   `ETHEREUM_NODE_URL`: URL of the Ethereum node to connect to (e.g., Infura, Alchemy).
*   `PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key of the Ethereum account used to deploy and interact with the smart contracts.
*   `GRAPH_NODE_URL`: URL of The Graph node.
*   `GRAPH_IDE_URL`: URL of The Graph IDE.
*   `MARKETPLACE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: Address of the deployed marketplace smart contract.

## Usage

1.  **Run the Go backend:**
    go run main.go

2.  **Interact with the API:** The backend exposes a REST API for interacting with the marketplace. Refer to the API documentation for details on the available endpoints. (Example API Documentation would be beneficial here but cannot be included due to length constraints)

Example:

To fetch all available NFTs:

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/nfts

To create a new NFT listing:

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"tokenId": 1, "price": "1000000000000000000"}' http://localhost:8080/listings
